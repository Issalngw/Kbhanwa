DePIN Infrastructure Specialist

I am the Founder of DePINNest, a decentralized electric mobility infrastructure network built on Solana. Our mission is to transform EV charging into an open, community-powered system by turning physical charging stations into on-chain, revenue-generating assets.

DePINNest integrates IoT hardware, blockchain settlement, and NFT-based Smart Wallets, enabling individuals and communities to fund, operate, and earn from real-world EV charging nodes. This creates transparent ownership, real-time monitoring, and sustainable incentives for operators, investors, and users.

We are building a scalable, crypto-enabled mobility network where communities don’t just use infrastructure, they own and benefit from it, accelerating global EV adoption through accessible, community-aligned charging infrastructure.
